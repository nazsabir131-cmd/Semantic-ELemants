                    <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs are one of the most loyal and intelligent animals in the world, often called “man’s best friend.” They belong to
                        the species Canis lupus familiaris and have been domesticated for thousands of years. There are over 340 different
                        breeds of dogs, ranging from tiny Chihuahuas to giant Great Danes, each with unique traits, sizes, and personalities.
                        Dogs have an extraordinary sense of smell, estimated to be up to 100,000 times stronger than humans, which is why they
                        are often trained to detect drugs, explosives, or even medical conditions like cancer and low blood sugar. They are also
                        highly social animals that thrive on companionship and communication, using body language, barking, and tail wagging to
                        express emotions. Beyond being pets, dogs play important roles as therapy animals, guide dogs for the blind, rescue
                        workers, and police or military helpers, making them not only lovable companions but also valuable partners in human
                        life.

                        Dogs are amazing animals that bring joy and comfort to peoples lives. They are very friendly, playful, and protective,
                        which makes them great family pets. Most dogs love outdoor activities like running, playing fetch, and going for walks.
                        They also have strong instincts to guard their owners and show affection by wagging their tails, licking, or cuddling.
                        With proper care, love, and training, dogs can become loyal companions and trusted friends for many years.
